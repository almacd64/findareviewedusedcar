# findareviewedusedcar

The project was part of the Coursera Full Stack Web Development course. This is my capstone project.

At the moment the folder structure is a little bit off, but I plan to fix that.

Also, there are bugs :-

1. When any screen is minimized the header links shrink to an icon (which is good), but the icon isn't expandable, 
so the links have actually gone (which is bad).


See it running at https://findareviewedusedcar2.herokuapp.com

Still to to :-
1. Add 'retrieve message' when the server is being re-started. <div ng-if="!data">Fetching data...</div>
2. Fix the hamburger.
3. Fix text 'kepp clear'.
4. Edit a review.
5. Show login details.
6. Delete a review.
7. Show your own reviews.
