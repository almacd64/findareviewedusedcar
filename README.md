# findareviewedusedcar

The project was part of the Coursera Full Stack Web Development course. This is my capstone project.

At the moment the folder structure is a little bit off, but I plan to fix that.

Also, there are bugs :-

1. When any screen is minimized the header links shrink to an icon (which is good), but the icon isn't expandable, 
so the links have actually gone (which is bad).
